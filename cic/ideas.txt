Meditation:

player sprite/shape in the middle.

orbs float into the center from the outside.

you control your own orb. this is your "awareness".

hover your orb over another and hold both triggers over it. it should dissipate.

hover your orb back over the player. alternate left and right triggers in regular intervals.
OR hold in triggers until about 80% down, hold, then release.

this process increases your awareness stat.

another idea: dissipating these orbs adds some information to like...a log or something?
anyway, it should add some interesting LORE or provide something other than stat boosts.
