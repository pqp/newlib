RANDOM EVENTS
------------------------------

In the clearing ahead you see a person standing over a ragged corpse. They turn towards you.

1) In your presence they lower their weapons: they are not interested in
   hurting you. They step closer to speak.

   "This man--this _wretch_--tried to steal food from me. He left me no choice; I struck him down."

   The silence gives way to the neon stream flitting and lapping over the rocks. The <person> steps aside to let you pass.
